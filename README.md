# LLM Engineer Technical Assessment

This submission focuses on translating the provided YAML specifications directly into deterministic Python code, without adding any interpretations or enhancements beyond what is explicitly defined.

Key principles followed in this work include:
- Avoiding any creative or subjective inference
- Clearly identifying and handling undefined or ambiguous logic
- Ensuring fully deterministic and reproducible behavior
- Validating inputs and outputs against the specified schemas
- Enforcing strict guardrails to prevent logic boundary violations

Any specifications that could not be implemented unambiguously were intentionally rejected and documented with clear reasoning.
